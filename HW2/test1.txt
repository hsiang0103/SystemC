I. Text Processing
Description
1. Open any file (the text file) by command input, e.g. run TheTextFile.
2. Implement a function to count in the file
How many lines (how many '\n' in the file and also the EOF)
How many characters (alphanumeric characters only, i.e. 'A'~'Z', 
'a'~'z', and '0'~'9')
How many uppercase letters ('A'~'Z')
How many words (separated by spaces (' ') and '\n')
3. Then, implement another function that converts all the text into 
uppercase and writes to a file named "UPPER." For example, given an 
original text as "The fox in the fog –%&9 catch me if you can." and 
convert it into "THE FOX IN THE FOG –%&9 CATCH ME IF YOU CAN."
